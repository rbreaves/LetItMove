# LetItMove
Move all of your x11 Windows to another Workspace quickly.

## Purpose
Only purpose of this script is to help users quickly clear out or separate work
related workspaces from more personal ones primarily. I am sure it can be applicable to
all sorts of other scenarios however.

The plan is to allow for a hotkey to execute this script and either locate all windows/apps
to one workspace and/or monitor w/ a few exceptions as they may make sense. For whatever
reason I do not see that a solution like this currently exists in the Linux distro/DE
landscape, and I am not aware of anything on Windows or Macs that I personally used.



## Other notes
Window tiling may serve as a bit of a solution for this, although I often do not care too
much for most of their implementations. In my opinion wm tiling is often too complicated &
non-obvious.

I currently have no plans to include ZenTile or anything other tiling solutions/features 
to this as it is intended to be pretty basic. May be interesting to explore later on though,
quick tiling via Zentile or something else.

If I did tiling it would likely be a switch/param that a hotkey can pass in to the script
and then either open the needed apps or re-arrange the existing ones running to a preset
layout by the user.
